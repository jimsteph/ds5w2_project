### Readme

This is the week 2 project for the Coursera/John Hopkins _Reproducable Results_ class.  The requirement for this project is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some questions, putting the results into the form of a report, as if I were writing it to a government employee.

This project consists of this readme, an R file with all the code, an RMarkdown document with the report, code, and conclusions, and an HTML file that is knitted from the RMarkdown document.  Details on the code and data are in the knitted document.
